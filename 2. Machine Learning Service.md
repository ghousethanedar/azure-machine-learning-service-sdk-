Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:


| Field  | Description |

|**Subscription**|	Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.|
|**Resource group**|	Use an existing resource group in your subscription, or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use docs-aml.|
|**Location**|	Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.|
|**Workspace edition**|	Select Enterprise. This tutorial requires the use of the Enterprise edition. The Enterprise edition is in preview and doesn't currently add any extra costs.|
    
 
    
**2. Go to the Machine Learning Service:**
  - Launch the new Azure Machine Learning studio
  
**3. Connect Datastores:**
  - Click in the Azure Machine Learning studio on "**Datastores**"
  - Click on "**New datastore**"
